## üöÄ The Problem

Tourists often face safety challenges in unfamiliar areas, especially in regions with poor connectivity. There is a lack of a unified, proactive system for authorities to monitor tourist well-being and respond efficiently to incidents, which can hinder the growth of tourism.

## ‚ú® Our Solution: Safar Saarthi

**Safar Saarthi** (Your Travel Companion) is a complete ecosystem connecting tourists, authorities, and intelligent systems to create a safety net for every traveler. Our solution is built on a proactive "predict and prevent" model rather than a reactive one.

## üîë Key Features

### üì± For Tourists (Flutter App)

* **Blockchain Digital ID:** A secure, tamper-proof, and time-bound digital identity for quick verification.
* **Real-time Geo-fencing Alerts:** Automatically warns tourists if they are about to enter a restricted or high-risk zone.
* **Instant SOS Button:** A one-tap panic button that sends the user's live location and digital ID to the nearest authorities.
* **Offline Capability:** Critical alerts are sent via SMS when internet connectivity is poor, ensuring help is always within reach.
* **AI-Powered Safety Score:** A dynamic score that alerts users to potentially risky behavior patterns.

### üëÆ For Authorities (React Web Dashboard)

* **Live Dashboard:** A real-time map showing tourist locations, active alerts, and incident hotspots.
* **AI-Driven Heatmaps:** Visualizes tourist density and clusters identified by our DBSCAN model to predict potential overcrowding.
* **Instant Alert Panels:** Receives and manages SOS requests and low safety score alerts from tourists.
* **Secure Verification:** Authorities can instantly verify a tourist's identity using their blockchain ID.
